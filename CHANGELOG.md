## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-08

First public stable release of `@entelligentsia/forgecli` — the Forge SDLC
ported onto `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`.

### Added

- **Three bin entries** (`forge`, `forgecli`, `4ge`) all routing to the same
  launcher. `4ge` and `forgecli` exist as collision-free aliases when the
  Foundry `forge` is on `$PATH`.
- **Bundled pi runtime.** `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.74.0`,
  `@earendil-works/pi-ai@0.74.0`, and `@earendil-works/pi-tui@0.74.0` are
  shipped via `bundledDependencies`, insulating installs from upstream
  npm-scope churn.
- **Bundled forge plugin payload** at `Entelligentsia/forge@v0.40.3`,
  re-shaped from the Claude-Code source layout via
  `substitute-placeholders.cjs --target pi`. Pin captured in
  `package.json:forge.bundledVersion`.
- **Five `/forge:*` slash commands** registered as native pi commands
  (FORGE-S16-T04): `/forge:ask`, `/forge:plan`, `/forge:run-task`,
  `/forge:run-sprint`, `/forge:health`.
- **Forge tools as pi custom tools** (FORGE-S16-T03): TypeBox-typed wrappers
  over `forge/tools/*.cjs` with argv-array invocation (no shell-string
  interpolation).
- **Curated provider/model registry** (FORGE-S16-T16) at
  `registry/models.json` covering six providers; missing-credentials banner
  surfaces the exact env var to set on first launch.
- **Default-on update-check probe and banner** (FORGE-S16-T14) — checks npm
  registry for newer `@entelligentsia/forgecli` and the GitHub releases API
  for newer `Entelligentsia/forge`. Two outbound URLs only; opt-out via
  `FORGE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` or `--no-update-check`.
- **`/forge:update` guided upgrade** (FORGE-S16-T15) — surfaces the upgrade
  command for forge-cli itself and prompts for project migrations when the
  installed forge plugin drifts from the bundled version.
- **Functional pre-publish E2E smoke gate** (FORGE-S16-T11) — auth-free
  gates mandatory; auth-required gates run when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is
  present.

### Distribution

- License: **MIT**.
- Stable-only `latest` dist-tag on npm; no `next` or `dev` channels (Q20).
- Public, scoped under `@entelligentsia` (Q22).
- Node.js `>=20.6.0` (matches pi-coding-agent's engines requirement).

### Out of scope for 0.1.0

- Multi-platform / multi-Node-version smoke matrix (deferred to v1.0).
- Telemetry / phone-home of any kind (Q21: none).
- `claude-agent-sdk` plan-limit support (deferred to S17+).
- Cost telemetry surfacing in `/forge:*` (waived for S16).
